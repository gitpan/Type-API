NAME
    Type::API - a common interface for type constraints, based on observed
    patterns (documentation only)

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution documents common patterns used by type constraint
    libraries: in particular the methods that type constraints typically
    provide, their parameters, return values, and expected behaviour.

    Type constraint libraries typically provide more methods than these, but
    by restricting your code to making use of those documented in Type::API,
    you may be able to improve your code's interoperability.
